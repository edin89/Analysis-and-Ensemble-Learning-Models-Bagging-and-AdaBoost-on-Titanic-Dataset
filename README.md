# Analysis-and-Ensemble-Learning-Models-Bagging-and-AdaBoost-on-Titanic-Dataset

This project focuses on the analysis and modeling of the "Titanic" dataset, specifically the train clean dataset. The tasks involve selecting and examining information of the top 10 highest fares paid by passengers and providing observations. Additionally, the percentage of females from the 1st class who survived is determined. An ensemble learning model using the bagging technique is built to improve predictive performance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is calculated and plotted for the bagging model, with the legend displaying the AUC-ROC score. Furthermore, a model using AdaBoost is built, and its performance is compared with the previous model to assess their relative effectiveness in predicting survival on the Titanic.
